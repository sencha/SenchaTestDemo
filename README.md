# SenchaTestDemo
Example workspaces to demonstrate use of Sencha Test

The 'AdminDashboard' and 'Workspace' workspaces need a copy of the Ext JS 6.0.1 framework. The content of the "ext" folder
from any Sencha Cmd generated app can be copied into these sub-folders to complete their
setup.

Once the "ext" folder is placed in the folder, that folder cna be opened in Sencha Studio
by selecting "Open Workspace".

## AdminDashboard
This is a single-application project using the Ext JS 6.0.1 application template and
decorated with a few starter tests. More to come here as Sencha Test approaches GA.

## Workspace
This is a workspace with two applications: the admin dashboard again and the stock
Sencha Cmd "starter" application.

## Ext4App
This is a single-application project using the Ext JS 4.2.5 application template.

## Ext5App
This is a single-application project using the Ext JS 5.1.1 application template.

## Touch2App
This is a single-application project using the Ext JS 2.4.2 application template.
